## Test Report
The issues found during testing have been created in the github repo

I also added manual test cases which can be found in the `time-keeper-test-cases.xlsx` file.

**Three** of the E2e test scenarios failed because the assertions are meant to test current issues in the web app. These tests will pass when the issues are fixed by the developer.
